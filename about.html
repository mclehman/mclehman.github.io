    <h1><code>(:background about)</code></h2>
        <p>I studied both math and computer science during my undergrad at <a href="asu.edu">ASU</a>.</p>
        <p>I have a soft spot for programming languages, type systems, and abstract algebra.</p>
        <p>Specifically, I've spent probably too much time digging into Perl 6 and various lisps.</p>
    <h1><code>(:current about)</code></h2>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at ASU as a member of the <a href="http://sefcom.asu.edu">SEFCOM</a> lab.</p>
        <p>My research focuses on the intersection of language design and security.</p>
